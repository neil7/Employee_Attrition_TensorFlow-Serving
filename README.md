# Employee_Attrition_TensorFlow-Serving
Almost all companies are more concerned about human resources. Selecting proper employees depending upon their performance is one of the issues of managers. Hence, “employee attrition” is one of the pressing issues. In most cases, employee turnover is very costly hence management builds an evaluation system in an attempt to keep the best performing employees.
Data Mining is an important field of knowledge discovery. Our team has developed a classification model to predict the performance of employees using data mining models.
Data Mining has several steps associated with it which we used.
The following are the steps we underwent to get the model.
1. Data Acquisition: It is a process of gathering data from different sources.
2. Data Cleaning: This is the most time-consuming stage. The data had so many inconsistencies and noise. So to build the model we cleaned and pre-processed the data by removing unnecessary data and null values.
3. Train Dataset: We created data features from data and split data randomly into training and test data.
4. Train Machine Learning Model: We built the Machine Learning model using all kinds of algorithms on the basis of the training dataset. We used models like KNN, Random Forest, SVM, etc.
5. Test Model: We evaluated and validated the training and test dataset and used a series of Machine Learning algorithms.
6. Deploy Model: We created the usable model and deployed it. The later model was constantly improved.
